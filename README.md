## Exploring the impact of COVID on air quality and single-use plastic  

We have seen many news articles boldly state that COVID has affected the environment in important ways. Some claim that it has "saved our planet" while others point to the rise in single-use plastic as a major concern. We noticed that these claims were rarely accompanied by data supporting their findings, so we wanted to assess the validity of these statements. This project was developed through Correlation One's [Data Science For All: Women's Summit 2020](https://www.correlation-one.com/ds4a).  

## Our aims in this project were to:  
1) Identify the trends in plastic production in the United States over the last 2 years and whether there has been an increase in the production due to the pandemic
2) Identify the increase in plastic due to the higher need for PPE
3) Map air pollution and air quality in the United States in the last 2 years and assess whether there has been an increase in air quality since the pandemic
4) Identify whether the increases in air quality imply lower CO2 concentrations (i.e. contribute to a long-term reduction in pollution)
